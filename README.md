# My-customized-font

Welcome to try!
I build it from Iosevka!

## For WINDOWS
if you are windows user:
you can install the fonts, and use it in vscode `settins.json` like:
```json
 "editor.fontFamily": " 'Iosevka Custom semiexpanded','....(other font)'",
```
if you want turn on ligature:
```json
  "editor.fontLigatures": "true",
```
you can also use `Iosevka Custom`,`Iosevka Custom expanded` to change the width.

if you are interested in building for youself:
See at `https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md`

## NOTES
I may change the variant and some features in the future version.

### If interested in other settings I use in vscode
Theme : `Everforest` Dark and change backgroud `#303030`. Sometimes I use `Gruvbox` dark instead.
Font: `Jetbrains Mono` or `Iosevka` and turn on ligature. For Chinese.I use `霞鹜文楷`
Terminal on Windows: Wezterm.
