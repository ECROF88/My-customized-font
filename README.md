# My-customized-font

Welcome to try!
I build it from Iosevka!

## For WINDOWS
if you are windows user:
you can install the fonts, and use it in vscode like:
```json
 "editor.fontFamily": " 'Iosevka Custom semiexpanded','....(other font)'",
```

you can also use `Iosevka Custom`,`Iosevka Custom expanded`.

if you are interested in building for youself:
See at `https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md`
